# This document is to be used as a template as all the base code is in English
# Basic HTML tags are allowed such as <b><i> etc. All data is sanitized https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML

# When updating the template you must also update the en version. If you don't and a new language with a new setting is used, it
# will NOT translate back after switching back to en

# How to create a new language:
#  1) Create a new folder in locale and copy the template, add the locale prefix (en, uwu, etc) to the start of the variable
#          (var translation -> var en_translation) then edit the template with your new languages words.
#  2) Go into the i18n.js and find `arrActiveLangs` and add the prefix to that array. ['en'] -> ['en', 'uwu']
#  3) Go into the i18n.js page and find `translatableLanguages` add your prefix and variable name
#              var translatableLanguages = {
#                  "en": en_translation
#              }
#        Turns into:
#              var translatableLanguages = {
#                  "en": en_translation
#                  "uwu": uwu_translation
#              }
#  4) Submit a push request to the github

# NOTE: If a section does NOT need translating, leave it empty.
# NOTE: Variables that MPW insert are denoted by brackets {}, for example, {button}, do NOT translate variables, but place them where it makes the most sense.
