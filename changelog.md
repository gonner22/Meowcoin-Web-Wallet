# New Features
- TX Database and Network Rewrite.
- Ability to delete an MPW wallet.

You'll notice that MPW now requires a small amount of 'syncing time' during your first use of v1.4.0, as MPW now synchronises your full TX history to your machine, so the next time you open the wallet, it instantly resumes using the chain data it previously synced.

This system will save massive amounts of bandwidth long-term, speed up operations, and allow MPW to implement more advanced features that AIPG Core have.
